Bengaluru House Prices Prediction with Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is 'bengaluru_house_prices'.

Overview
This repository contains:

Datasets: The 'bengaluru_house_prices' dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
Client: Directory for any client-side code or user interface components.
Model: Contains trained models and model-related files.
Server: Server-side code, including Flask API and artifacts directory to store model-related files.
Project Details
Internship: This project was developed as part of my virtual internship with Bharat Intern.
Purpose: The objective was to create a robust machine learning model for house price prediction.
